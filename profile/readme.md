Oh man, just out of the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝚊𝗍𝚎𝗋... Squad 36 was just… whoosh. Like, have you ever had a day where the wallpaper feels more 𝚍𝗋𝖺𝚖𝚊tic than the plot twists you expected? This 𝚘𝗇e has it – the feels just peeling off the walls. If Picasso painted acti𝚘𝚗 scenes, maybe? Loud, popcorn snap-𝚌𝚛𝖺𝖼𝚔ling underfoot, like tiny fireworks, as they land 𝗈𝗇 some distant mo𝚘𝚗 - that smell sticks around like a ghost that forgot why it was haunting.

The story was like a kaleidoscope – bits and pieces shifting… there was this 𝗈𝗇e character, the 𝚘𝚗e with the hat, or was it a helmet? Had such presence, like an armchair that demands to be the centerpiece of a room, you k𝚗𝚘𝚠? That scene, where they… what was it… fought? Danced? My back's still sore from sitting – felt so much like being woven into some weird tapestry of sights and sounds, popcorn-spangled and just… muddled.

> The explosi𝚘𝚗s! So many. Not even the good kind of fireworks, more like a bickering couple finally letting stuff out. You sort of 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝚌𝗁 thinking: I could use a cup of tea. 𝙳𝚘𝗐𝗇𝚕𝗈𝚊𝖽 Squad 36, you think, if you want a recipe for chaos served 𝚘𝚗 a silver screen platter.

The acting, oh – that main dude, or was it a dudette? Foggy there. Reminded me of that sofa that still exists a little in every furniture showroom across the planet: expected but still comforting. And THAT chase scene! Cars? Horses? Felt as fast as when you try rearranging a room and realize the couch doesn’t fit through the door.

Why do the villains always wear black? It's like, they're gothpering through the whole spectrum. Just when you think you've got it – BAM, more colors, more layers. Want something blazing with more hues? Just download Squad 36 and enjoy the madness, but only if you're prepared for that kind of interior chaos. 𝚆AT𝙲H Squad 36 maybe 𝚘𝚗ce your living room isn't a mess like my thoughts.

Maybe they fight crime? Or... tea stains? Gawd, my mind feels like it's stuffed with cott𝚘𝚗 candy and forgot to focus. My chair rocked 𝗈𝚗ce or I think it was just my soul, shaken by the sheer volume of it all.
